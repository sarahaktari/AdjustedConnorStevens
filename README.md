# AdjustedConnorStevens
a different take on the connor stevens neuron model in MATLAB 
applied varying evels of current affects the firing rate of action potentials in a Connor Stevens model of a neuron
recorded the number of action potentials fired with no applied current and compared that control value to the number of action potentials fired after increasing the applied current by intervals of 100 picoAmps until a max applied current of 3000 picoAmps
